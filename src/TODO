BALANCE HISTORY

02.05 changes
    mod stat by copper spell chances 0.25 => 0.15
    health potion value scaling 1.0 => 0.5

02.05 games
    died twice again
    both times kind of because of my own mistakes?
    first time felt a bit unfair though
    beat the game once
        was fairly difficult at the start, got a bit easy in later levels
        felt like too many health potions

30.04 game
    decent, got some challenge
    i died because i rushed into an enemy
    need to play some more to know if this is hard vs impossible

24.04 changes
    MERCHANT_ITEM_COST scaling 2.5 => 3.0
    enemy health scaling 2.5 => 3.0
    healthmax value scaling 1.0 => 0.25
        no point in scaling health maxes, almost linear scaling is fine
    healthmax chance 1.5 => 3.0 (if none for 2 floors) else 0.0
    enemy/item room armor chance 3.0 => 1.5
    enemy/item room weapon chance 0.5 => 0.25
    chest potion chance 2.0 => 1.0
    add random_orb to unlocked_chest
    add random_orb to locked_chest
    enemy room random_orb chance 1.5 => 1.0
    equipment ModAttackByCopper and ModDefenseByCopper chance 1.0 => 0.25

23.04 game
    first half good, second half slightly easy
    too much health from healthmax's
    enemies die in 2 hits

19.04 changes
    ENEMY_ITEM_IDEAL_RATIO      0.6 => 0.7
        too easy in general
    HEALTH_POTION_TALLY_SIZE    10 => 15
        too many health potions last game
    enemy health scaling        2.0 => 2.5
        in the later half sometimes one-hit enemies
    new map variation might mess with balance a bit as well
