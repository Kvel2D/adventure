TODO

make sure enemies have enough health
    need to at least be able to hit back once

try generating enemy tiles
    completely random?
    pattern-based
    automata

DONE

IDEAS

compare merchant stats to player stats progression
    make merchant almost impossible to kill
    
how to tell the player that they "won"?
    also figure out where the max floor is
    could add some more to the current ones if it scales well
