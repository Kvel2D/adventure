TODO

friendly mobs
    make them green to easily distinguish
    can attack friendlies to prevent path blocks
    friendlies and enemies fight each other
        when deciding who to follow or attack, enemies select closest one out of friendlies or player
            but prio player, so the loop that selects lowest distance first goes through frendlies then checks player, so player will always be selected if distances are the same
        friendlies select closest enemy
    friendly mobs naturally occur on levels(rarely)

    summon - create friendly mob
    charm - turn enemy into friendly

    aoe spells damage friendlies as well?
        could be a nice tradeoff

PROBLEMS

fat connections still sometimes go out of room bounds

killed merchant but picked up item and still had buy component on

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool

find font that's not messed up in html5

scrolling for spell display, at some point spells won't fit in current area

boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
        copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
        spawning 3 skeletons in same room spawns a necromancer at stairs
        killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

change color scheme every 3 levels, maybe put a boss at every 3rd level too

insert random patterns in rooms sometimes
    cross-sections
    columns(series of one-off blocks)
    hole in middle

vary room geometry by level
    restrict sizes to certain ranges
        all small rooms or all big rooms
        also connection factors

equipment names

cursed equipment
    both positive and negative bonuses are outside of normal range, so it gives very high positives and negatives
    don't want to affect normal equipment though, it should be a completely separate range of weights
    making the normal weight range extend higher won't work

statue that converts your copper into stats

keys should have some danger associated with them
    put them in enemy rooms and maybe increase the average amount of enemies in those rooms?
