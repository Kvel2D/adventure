IDEAS

need option to toggle tile patterns 
    should be saved to shareobject
    needs to be instant
    make it an escape/tab menu, like the dev menu buttons

compare merchant stats to player stats progression
    make merchant almost impossible to kill

try generating enemy tiles

how to tell the player that they "won"?
    also figure out where the max floor is
    could add some more to the current ones if it scales well
