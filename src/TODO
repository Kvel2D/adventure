IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool

    boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
        copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
        spawning 3 skeletons in same room spawns a necromancer at stairs
        killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

find font that's not messed up in html5

custom equipment and item names
    preset names that progress together with levels?
    copper sword/dagger/staff/hammer -> iron -> ...

improve locked things
    for chests, keys could drop be inserted into a mob's droptable
        DropKey component that guarantees a drop of key

    for doors, just locking a single room with item is the same as a locked chest
    need to figure out how to lock a section of the map and place a key on the side reachable by player

need to clean up map by removing connections that cross rooms
    replace with two connections that connect to room

enchant equipment effect
    add a random spell(call the normal spell creation functions for type)
