IDEAS

improve messages for spell effects

location teleport to another area

statue that consumes health and has a chance to spawn items

maybe don't say how much percentages are for most things
    distracting and shouldn't matter anyway
    one problem is that when you have two items of same type with same spell you can't see if one of them is better than other
        unless you assume that one is better if you know it came from higher floor

work on statues
    change statue spawn mechanic
    spawn at least one per 1-3 levels, with possibility of multiple

statue that spawns more enemies
