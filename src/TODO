PROBLEMS

IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool
    low chase distance so that player can choose when to engage

boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
    copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
    spawning 3 skeletons in same room spawns a necromancer at stairs
    killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

improve locked things
    for chests, keys could drop be inserted into a mob's droptable
        DropKey component that guarantees a drop of key

    for doors, just locking a single room with item is the same as a locked chest
    need to figure out how to lock a section of the map and place a key on the side reachable by player

redistribute spells between scrolls and potions

diversify spells more
    lots of spell variations are not utilized

combust spell
    explode enemy damaging everything(player too) around it in a radius

sleep spell
    like passify but turns enemy into neutral_to_aggressive(remember to remove Move component)

copper to attack
    ring/armor spell, passively converts all copper to attack(floor function), not too powerful, also scales worse as copper count increases

copper to def

copper item
    drops from chests
    copper just from enemies isn't interesting

render better on death screen

add darkened tiles for teleport and poison
