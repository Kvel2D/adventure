TODO

friendly mobs
    make friendly mobs green
    picking up and dropping friendly enemy is like pokemon
        pick up an enemy like that and drop it and let it fight other enemies for you
    can attack friendly to prevent path blocks

PROBLEMS

fat connections still sometimes go out of room bounds

killed merchant but picked up item and still had buy component on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool

find font that's not messed up in html5

scrolling for spell display, at some point spells won't fit in current area

boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
        copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
        spawning 3 skeletons in same room spawns a necromancer at stairs
        killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

change color scheme every 3 levels, maybe put a boss at every 3rd level too

insert random patterns in rooms sometimes
    cross-sections
    columns(series of one-off blocks)
    hole in middle

vary room geometry by level
    restrict sizes to certain ranges
        all small rooms or all big rooms
        also connection factors

equipment names

cursed equipment
    both positive and negative bonuses are outside of normal range, so it gives very high positives and negatives
    don't want to affect normal equipment though, it should be a completely separate range of weights
    making the normal weight range extend higher won't work

statue that converts your copper into stats

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPELL IDEAS

enchanting equipment
    increase attack/defense of equipped weapon/armor
    only affects certain slot
