IDEAS

default actions on left-click
    enemies = attack
    usable = use
    enemies and use => no action
        then need attack option in context menu

rings and amulets(regular item with max amount in inventory?)

display spell effect in tooltip
    start as "unknown"
    after one use, it will say what it actually is

make combat non-instant, currently deciding to attack or not is a math problem and you can't use items during the fight
make it real-time?

portals

line of sight
    can't see behind doors
    view distance limited
    remember entity once seen?

spell scrolls
    increase attack for next N fights
    absorb X damage for next N fights
    increase movement speed(double?)

aura system
    buffs/poison/interact object effects translate into auras that affect the player, auras have time which ticks down, displayed in a list under stats

cells with effects
    poison - works like bloodborne, but full damage instantly at completion of meter, meter invisible, in effect allows for constant accumulation of poison in realtime which periodically "ticks"
    straight damage when stepping on for the first time (lava)

doors opened with buttons
    can make rooms be one-way entrance by putting a button and a door at the entrance
    (one way entrance poison room)

chests

merchant block entrance to shop storage which contains a chest
    could attack merchant to open the way and get the chest but merchant is deadly

boots that make you immune to lava

crab-hand
    crabs can be attacked but also can be used to gain +X to dmg for a limited time while taking damage periodically
    this is an aura
    crab disappears on end

swap hp spell
    swap your and mob's hp
    the only real way to "level up" hp, bought for a ton of money or a rare

pushable blocks ala sokoban
    use blocks to push a button to open a door
    but block is surround by enemies, need to clear them to be able to push it
    pushed by moving next to block
    can grab block for undoing purposes by holding G

refine room generation

rival component - contains it's own "faction" and an enemy "faction", they attack each other instead of player if they are close

moving entities should avoid the positions around choke points to prevent cheesing

probably will need to cache entity tiles as well

can optimize map draw further by predrawing the whole map as view-sized segments and drawing the 4 segments that intersect current view

locked chests that need keys
locked doors that need keys(key spawned randomly in world a bit far away from door)
