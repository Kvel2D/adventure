PROBLEMS

IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool

friendly mobs
    make friendly mobs green
    picking up and dropping friendly enemy is like pokemon
        pick up an enemy like that and drop it and let it fight other enemies for you
    can attack friendly to prevent path blocks
    friendly mobs which attack other mobs
        other mobs should attack them as well?
    spell to summon friendly mob

identify system
    only applies to use effects(maybe special armor buffs too?)
    once used a spell once, can see the same type everywhere else
    identifying a use spell identifies all similar spells everywhere

cache map image
    redraw on new map rect additions or removals
    draw player on top of cache
    need to clear transparently

armor/weapon use and buff spells
armor/weapon buff spells

find font that's not messed up in html5

scrolling for spell display, at some point spells won't fit in current area

start with some items?
    could be like a class system where you start with certain loadouts

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPELL IDEAS

crab-hand
    crabs can be attacked but also can be used to gain +X to dmg for a limited time while taking damage periodically
    this is an aura
    crab disappears on end

mod equipment stat
    mod attack doesn't cover all options, it modifies natural attack only
    mod attack of weapon would only modify the weapon which presents an interesting choice of whether to enchant weapon now to get power now or save it for later to enchant a more powerful item

    mod attack should affect a specific element
    ex: enchant weapon with ice -> +1 ice attack

    could make it general: enchant equipment's ice power:
    increases attack or defense

    enchanting works like this:
        use the enchant item => set enchant flag
        if enchant flag => add "enchant" option in interact

    enchanting items/rings?
        could be fun

    two types of enchant:
        one that adds element power even if it's 0
        other that only increases existing element
            so enchanting ice on a sword with 1 phys dmg will do nothing 

modhealth everyattack
    something like leech
    most appropriate for weapons

copy scroll used on copy scroll could spawn a rare hard encounter on next level
    "You hear a distant wail of a Copy Scroll God"
