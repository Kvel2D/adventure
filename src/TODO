TODO

energyshield equip effect on armor can work if it absorbs damage every N attacks
    
moving lava room

make all stationary or passive enemies attack on proximity, otherwise they have no point
not fun to guess if enemy will attack or not, should just always attack

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEMS

fat connections still sometimes go out of room bounds

killed merchant but picked up item and still had buy component on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool

friendly mobs
    make friendly mobs green
    picking up and dropping friendly enemy is like pokemon
        pick up an enemy like that and drop it and let it fight other enemies for you
    can attack friendly to prevent path blocks
    friendly mobs which attack other mobs
        other mobs should attack them as well?
    spell to summon friendly mob

find font that's not messed up in html5

scrolling for spell display, at some point spells won't fit in current area

boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
        copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
        spawning 3 skeletons in same room spawns a necromancer at stairs
        killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

change color scheme every 3 levels, maybe put a boss at every 3rd level too

room with enemies where your hp is reduced but your attack is continiously increased

insert random patterns in rooms sometimes
    cross-sections
    columns(series of one-off blocks)
    hole in middle

vary room geometry by level
    restrict sizes to certain ranges
        all small rooms or all big rooms
        also connection factors

equipment names

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPELL IDEAS

mod equipment stat
    the use item should be separate from scroll
        "enchanting stone" or something
    mod attack doesn't cover all options, it modifies natural attack only
    mod attack of weapon would only modify the weapon which presents an interesting choice of whether to enchant weapon now to get power now or save it for later to enchant a more powerful item

    mod attack should affect a specific element
    ex: enchant weapon with ice -> +1 ice attack

    could make it general: enchant equipment's ice power:
    increases attack or defense

    enchanting works like this:
        use the enchant item => set enchant flag
        if enchant flag => add "enchant" option in interact

    enchanting items/rings?
        could be fun

    two types of enchant:
        one that adds element power even if it's 0
        other that only increases existing element
            so enchanting ice on a sword with 1 phys dmg will do nothing 

charm
    turn enemy into friendly

passify
    turn aggressive enemy into passive
