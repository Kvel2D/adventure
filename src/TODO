PROBLEMS

openfl release has an error in compress/uncompress for flash (github.com/openfl/starling/issues/117)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool
    low chase distance so that player can choose when to engage

    boss summon rituals
        doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
        copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
        spawning 3 times on same floor spawns a necromancer at stairs
        killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

locked doors
    just locking a single room with item is the same as a locked chest
    need to figure out how to lock a section of the map and place a key on the side reachable by player

improve messages for spell effects

location teleport to another area

statue spell - duplicate enemies on level
    can get more drops
    can increase benefit further by first damaging all enemies on level
        duplicated enemies will have same hp/max hp as originals

amnesia potion
    redo a level(it's different though, to avoid infinite amnesia cycles)

crit spell
    chance to deal double damage

    same for damage dealt to player as negative

    have doubts if good, need to test extensively

charm spell

distribute spells for armors

might be better to coordinate scales for various stats
    attack bonuses should scale the same for potions/armor/statues/rings etc for it to be fair
    other stats as well

censor bad names

find more healing potions spell for equipment
    increashes healing potion chance from world spawns and monster drops
    eats into "none" drop(reduces it) instead of decreasing other drop chances

alchemy orb spell
    turn items into other items
    turn armor into random orb
    turn scroll into random potion
    etc

statue that consumes health and has a chance to spawn items

maybe don't say how much percentages are for most things
    distracting and shouldn't matter anyway
    one problem is that when you have two items of same type with same spell you can't see if one of them is better than other
        unless you assume that one is better if you know it came from higher floor
