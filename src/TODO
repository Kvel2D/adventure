IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool
    low chase distance so that player can choose when to engage

boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
    copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
    spawning 3 times on same floor spawns a necromancer at stairs
    killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

improve locked things
    for chests, keys could drop be inserted into a mob's droptable
        DropKey component that guarantees a drop of key

    for doors, just locking a single room with item is the same as a locked chest
    need to figure out how to lock a section of the map and place a key on the side reachable by player

    put some distance between keys and chests
        when spawning keys, do a random walk from a chest, following the chain of adjacent rooms

redistribute spells between items and equipment

diversify spells more
    lots of spell variations aren't in

improve messages for spell effects

add unreachable rooms
    randomly but with some certainity
    use for noclip spell, some good stuff should be inside

too many health pots

maybe remove ranged enemies
    combat with them is too awkward

max health thing NEEDS to be dealt with
    currently accidentaly swapping between armor with +max health decreases your hp

change copper to always drop as items
    its more fun to click on item rather than have the counter increment automatically

    modcopper still mod amount or mod chance?
        i think chance is better because want to see the change

    drop needs to not obstruct the drops of other types
