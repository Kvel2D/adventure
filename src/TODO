IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool
    low chase distance so that player can choose when to engage

boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
    copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
    spawning 3 skeletons in same room spawns a necromancer at stairs
    killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

improve locked things
    for chests, keys could drop be inserted into a mob's droptable
        DropKey component that guarantees a drop of key

    for doors, just locking a single room with item is the same as a locked chest
    need to figure out how to lock a section of the map and place a key on the side reachable by player

redistribute spells between scrolls and potions

diversify spells more
    lots of spell variations are not utilized
