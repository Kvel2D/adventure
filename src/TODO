PROBLEMS

IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool

    boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
        copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
        spawning 3 skeletons in same room spawns a necromancer at stairs
        killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

find font that's not messed up in html5
    enemy letters are offset
    other letters have lower parts cut off unless there's another line under them

custom equipment and item names
    preset names that progress together with levels?
    copper sword/dagger/staff/hammer -> iron -> ...

improve locked things
    for chests, keys could drop be inserted into a mob's droptable
        DropKey component that guarantees a drop of key

    for doors, just locking a single room with item is the same as a locked chest
    need to figure out how to lock a section of the map and place a key on the side reachable by player

redistribute spells between scrolls and potions

diversify spells more
    lots of spell variations are not utilized
