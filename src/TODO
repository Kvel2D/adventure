TODO

usable in-world entities
    statue you sacrifice 5 hp to, to get some buff
    something like sacrificing a ton of health or even stats to make drops on the level more powerful would be cool

defense potions should be either for all elements of for single element with very high value

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEMS

entities with random movement can move into other rooms
    possible feature

speed spell makes it hard to get through connections
    possible feature

IDEAS

friendly mobs which attack other mobs
    other mobs should attack them as well?

cells with effects
    poison - works like bloodborne, but full damage instantly at completion of meter, meter invisible, in effect allows for constant accumulation of poison in realtime which periodically "ticks"
    straight damage when stepping on for the first time (lava)

doors opened with buttons
    can make rooms be one-way entrance by putting a button and a door at the entrance
    (one way entrance poison room)

merchant
    sells 3-4 random items like potions/scrolls
        rare stuff is very expensive
    merchants can attack as a buffer if item drops are crap
    merchant block entrance to a cut-off room
    could attack merchant to open the way and get stuff inside but merchant is deadly

crab-hand
    crabs can be attacked but also can be used to gain +X to dmg for a limited time while taking damage periodically
    this is an aura
    crab disappears on end

pushable blocks ala sokoban
    use blocks to push a button to open a door
    but block is surround by enemies, need to clear them to be able to push it
    pushed by moving next to block
    can grab block for undoing purposes by holding G

locked doors that need keys(key spawned randomly in world a bit far away from door)

long-range attack for entities
    attacks player if no LOS(i.e. player can see it)

spell that buffs entities
    increase random entity's health and attack
    increase all entity's health but also drop amount

increase effect of element in general
    increase light = higher light dmg, higher light heal amount, etc.(higher light dmg taken?)
    decrease light = lower light dmg, lower light heal, lower light dmg taken

spell ideas
    invisibility, enemies can't chase you
    cure poison
    extra life, restore full hp once when dying
    swap stats with enemy
        health, attacks, defenses

entity editor in-game
    edit/add/remove all components

mod equipment stat
    mod attack doesn't cover all options, it modifies natural attack only
    mod attack of weapon would only modify the weapon which presents an interesting choice of whether to enchant weapon now to get power now or save it for later to enchant a more powerful item

    mod attack should affect a specific element
    ex: enchant weapon with ice -> +1 ice attack

    could make it general: enchant equipment's ice power:
    increases attack or defense

    enchanting works like this:
        use the enchant item => set enchant flag
        if enchant flag => add "enchant" option in interact

    enchanting items/rings?
        could be fun

    two types of enchant:
        one that adds element power even if it's 0
        other that only increases existing element
            so enchanting ice on a sword with 1 phys dmg will do nothing 

ranged attacks
    entities can attack if 2-3-4 away from player

other move types
    keep distance
        entity does nothing but when player to entity distance is lower than X it tries to get away
    chase and keep distance
        for entities with ranged attacks, they will chase player until reaching attack distance then try to keep distance

vary room geometry
    cut off walls around edges(keep connections)
    add walls inside rooms

dropping/equipping decrements spell counters
    not sure if good but i think i still do want item interactions to take a turn

make spell_effect_text() for what to print
    make a distinction between positive and negative values
    modhealth+1 = heal for 1
    modhealth-1 = damage by 1(damage? idk something else)

mob that heals itself over time
    new kind of spell ModEntityHealth?

make entities have defense instead of absorb because right now it's inconsistent with what the player sees, better for it to be same to be more easily understandble

attacking always takes prio, might need to disable attack while interact menu is up

browsers need hardware acceleration apparently, need to put a note on game site

find a good font, that doesn't have scaling or offset problems
    also preferably mob chars should be full-width, hard to judge the distance if char not centered

scrolling for spell display, at some point spells won't fit in current area

figure out copper drop amount

weapons buffs   
    base attack buffs
    physical or physical + element or only element(rare)
    single element weapons have "of Element" in name
    or all elements("of Radiance")
    +
    extra buffs for higher level weapons
    or even use

potion that has two spells
    one helpful that's better than usual
    one unhelpful to offset

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool

SPELL decrease stat of everything on level
    includes all entities, items, equipment, in world or carried
    also all future items dropped/spawned on this level
    something like -1 to light attack might be good
        imagine you get to a level with a bunch of light mobs
        then you can use this spell to make it easier to clear
        but this will also decrease usefulness of your light weapon for example
    increase is fun too
        increase all attack makes item drops more valuable but everything also hits harder

scroll items
    contain mostly special effects

enemy chest
    just a regular enemy with 100% droprate

color enemies according to their strongest element

spell to show locked things on map
    and/or keys?

different attack pattern weapons
    spear = damage everything 2-3 in front of you
    axe = damage everything around you
    whip = cleave, jumps from one entity to another(no branches)
    offset by less dmg on single target

start with 5 charge heal potion?
    be able to select starting item

picking up and dropping friendly enemy is like pokemon
    pick up an enemy like that and drop it and let it fight other enemies for you

summon friendly enemy spell

portals
    two-way, connected to specific locations
    port via interact menu?

locked doors
    need to spawn them and matching keys such that it's possible to unlock
    (don't lock the key behind the door)

aoe damage spell
    radius around player
    or the whole room

modhealth everyattack
    something like leech

summon friendly mobs spell
    moving or stationary

show whether mob is friendly or aggressive in tooltip
    disallow attacking friendly mobs so that player is more likely to check that he can interact and pick it up

reign of shadow spell
    remove everything with light element from the level, entities drop items when removed
    includes player items/equipment?

copy scroll spell
    probably on another scroll
    copies another scroll exactly

add use charges spell
    probably very rare, because can be extremely powerful

swap defense spell should
    give mob's natural defense to player
    but give natural+mods defense of player to mob

decrease attack of EVERYTHING on the level(includes player's stuff)

need to make sure that friendly mobs can't cause a path block
    making it possible to attack them would allow the player to get out of any possible buggy situation

identify system
    only applies to use effects(maybe special armor buffs too?)
    once used a spell once, can see the same type everywhere else
    identifying a use spell identifies all similar spells everywhere

cache map image
    redraw on new map rect additions or removals
    draw player on top of cache
    need to clear transparently

door-button pair
    button is not a step on button but a touch button
        can be activated by anything near it, enemies, dropped items, etc
        combination of a button far away from door
        door in connection
        spawn to close an isolated room with one connection that contains something good

make friendly mobs green

armor/weapon use and buff spells
armor/weapon buff spells

"-health by element" spell
    player burning shouldn't be just -X health, should be X fire damage so defense can come into play
