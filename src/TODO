TODO

make connections be rooms as well

for each entity, save it's current room in Position, update of set_position
    only update entities that are in current player room
    OR currently in view?

make enemies move towards player
    assign each entity to a room, remember which room entity is in
    do a_star only for the room
    need to figure out which room player is in
        entities only chase while in same room
    only process chase components for entities in current room
    entities should avoid the positions around choke points to prevent cheesing

IDEAS

rings and amulets(regular item with max amount in inventory?)

display spell effect in tooltip
    start as "unknown"
    after one use, it will say what it actually is

portals

spell scrolls
    increase attack for next N fights
    absorb X damage for next N fights
    increase movement speed(double?)

aura system
    buffs/poison/interact object effects translate into auras that affect the player, auras have time which ticks down, displayed in a list under stats

cells with effects
    poison - works like bloodborne, but full damage instantly at completion of meter, meter invisible, in effect allows for constant accumulation of poison in realtime which periodically "ticks"
    straight damage when stepping on for the first time (lava)

doors opened with buttons
    can make rooms be one-way entrance by putting a button and a door at the entrance
    (one way entrance poison room)

merchant block entrance to shop storage which contains a chest
    could attack merchant to open the way and get the chest but merchant is deadly

boots that make you immune to lava

crab-hand
    crabs can be attacked but also can be used to gain +X to dmg for a limited time while taking damage periodically
    this is an aura
    crab disappears on end

swap hp spell
    swap your and mob's hp
    the only real way to "level up" hp, bought for a ton of money or a rare

pushable blocks ala sokoban
    use blocks to push a button to open a door
    but block is surround by enemies, need to clear them to be able to push it
    pushed by moving next to block
    can grab block for undoing purposes by holding G

rival component - contains it's own "faction" and an enemy "faction", they attack each other instead of player if they are close

locked chests that need keys
locked doors that need keys(key spawned randomly in world a bit far away from door)

long-range attack for entities
    attacks player if no LOS(i.e. player can see it)

dmg numbers above player that float up
    makes it more obvious when you are hit

default actions on left-click
    enemies = attack
    usable = use
    enemies and use => no action
        then need attack option in context menu

elements system
    fire, lightning, shadow(maybe something else too)
    each dmg bonus and stuff is one of those
    regular dmg is melee
    mobs can be immune to some elements, including melee
        ex: a mob that can only be defeated with shadow
    dmg bonus spells for same element don't stack
        +2fire dmg followed by +4fire dmg = +4fire dmg
        limits the max amount of bonus you can get
        have to use multiple elements if you want to go crazy

make levels
    the world could be a tower
