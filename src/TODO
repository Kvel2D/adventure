PROBLEMS

openfl release has an error in compress/uncompress for flash (github.com/openfl/starling/issues/117)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool
    low chase distance so that player can choose when to engage

    boss summon rituals
        doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
        copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
        spawning 3 times on same floor spawns a necromancer at stairs
        killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

locked doors
    just locking a single room with item is the same as a locked chest
    need to figure out how to lock a section of the map and place a key on the side reachable by player

improve messages for spell effects

location teleport to another area

statue spell - duplicate enemies on level
    can get more drops
    can increase benefit further by first damaging all enemies on level
        duplicated enemies will have same hp/max hp as originals

amnesia potion
    redo a level(it's different though, to avoid infinite amnesia cycles)

crit spell
    chance to deal double damage

    same for damage dealt to player as negative

    have doubts if good, need to test extensively

figure out if always using straight pathfinding for enemies works

charm spell

distribute spells for armors

might be better to coordinate scales for various stats
    attack bonuses should scale the same for potions/armor/statues/rings etc for it to be fair
    other stats as well
