TODO

make merchant sell better things
    like multi-charge potions/scrolls
    or higher level equipment/rings

merchant entity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEMS

entities with random movement can move into other rooms
    possible feature

speed spell makes it hard to get through connections
    possible feature

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS

doors opened with buttons
    can make rooms be one-way entrance by putting a button and a door at the entrance
    (one way entrance poison room)

pushable blocks ala sokoban
    use blocks to push a button to open a door
    but block is surround by enemies, need to clear them to be able to push it
    pushed by moving next to block
    can grab block for undoing purposes by holding G

long-range attack for entities
    attacks player if no LOS(i.e. player can see it)

ranged attacks
    entities can attack if 2-3-4 away from player

other move types
    keep distance
        entity does nothing but when player to entity distance is lower than X it tries to get away
    chase and keep distance
        for entities with ranged attacks, they will chase player until reaching attack distance then try to keep distance

vary room geometry
    cut off walls around edges(keep connections)
    add walls inside rooms

mob that heals itself over time
    new kind of spell ModEntityHealth?

make entities have defense instead of absorb because right now it's inconsistent with what the player sees, better for it to be same to be more easily understandble

attacking always takes prio, might need to disable attack while interact menu is up

browsers need hardware acceleration apparently, need to put a note on game site

find a good font, that doesn't have scaling or offset problems
    also preferably mob chars should be full-width, hard to judge the distance if char not centered

scrolling for spell display, at some point spells won't fit in current area

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool

start with some items?
    could be like a class system where you start with certain loadouts

picking up and dropping friendly enemy is like pokemon
    pick up an enemy like that and drop it and let it fight other enemies for you

show whether mob is friendly or aggressive in tooltip
    disallow attacking friendly mobs so that player is more likely to check that he can interact and pick it up

decrease attack of EVERYTHING on the level(includes player's stuff)

need to make sure that friendly mobs can't cause a path block
    making it possible to attack them would allow the player to get out of any possible buggy situation

identify system
    only applies to use effects(maybe special armor buffs too?)
    once used a spell once, can see the same type everywhere else
    identifying a use spell identifies all similar spells everywhere

cache map image
    redraw on new map rect additions or removals
    draw player on top of cache
    need to clear transparently

door-button pair
    button is not a step on button but a touch button
        can be activated by anything near it, enemies, dropped items, etc
        combination of a button far away from door
        door in connection
        spawn to close an isolated room with one connection that contains something good

make friendly mobs green

armor/weapon use and buff spells
armor/weapon buff spells

using items on anything might be needed
    some situations where would want to use heal potion on summoned entity for example
    "Use on target" interact option?

friendly mobs which attack other mobs
    other mobs should attack them as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPELL IDEAS

crab-hand
    crabs can be attacked but also can be used to gain +X to dmg for a limited time while taking damage periodically
    this is an aura
    crab disappears on end

spell that buffs entities
    increase random entity's health and attack
    increase all entity's health but also drop amount

invisibility, enemies can't chase you

extra life, restore full hp once when dying

swap stats with enemy: health, attacks, defenses
    swap defense spell should
    give mob's natural defense to player
    but give natural+mods defense of player to mob

cure poison

mod equipment stat
    mod attack doesn't cover all options, it modifies natural attack only
    mod attack of weapon would only modify the weapon which presents an interesting choice of whether to enchant weapon now to get power now or save it for later to enchant a more powerful item

    mod attack should affect a specific element
    ex: enchant weapon with ice -> +1 ice attack

    could make it general: enchant equipment's ice power:
    increases attack or defense

    enchanting works like this:
        use the enchant item => set enchant flag
        if enchant flag => add "enchant" option in interact

    enchanting items/rings?
        could be fun

    two types of enchant:
        one that adds element power even if it's 0
        other that only increases existing element
            so enchanting ice on a sword with 1 phys dmg will do nothing 

decrease stat of everything on level
    includes all entities, items, equipment, in world or carried
    also all future items dropped/spawned on this level
    something like -1 to light attack might be good
        imagine you get to a level with a bunch of light mobs
        then you can use this spell to make it easier to clear
        but this will also decrease usefulness of your light weapon for example
    increase is fun too
        increase all attack makes item drops more valuable but everything also hits harder

summon friendly enemy spell

predict element types of enemies on next level
    will need to pre-generate to be able to tell
    not too much info, something like "you will meet many shadowy figures" is enough
    "many chilling sights"
    "many burning encounters"
    "many blinding visages"

modhealth everyattack
    something like leech
    most appropriate for weapons

reign of shadow spell
    remove everything with light element from the level, entities drop items when removed
    includes player items/equipment?

add use charges spell
    probably very rare, because can be extremely powerful

"-health by element" spell
    player burning shouldn't be just -X health, should be X fire damage so defense can come into play

copy scroll
    need a system for spells that target an entity
    press "Use" and then if spell needs a target, go into targeting mode
    click on entity to use spell on it
    click anywhere else to cancel

    copy scroll used on copy scroll could spawn a rare hard encounter on next level
    "You hear a distant wail of a Copy Scroll God"

increase power of spawned items
    +1 to level of everything for the duration of the spell

pure absorb spell
    absorb all damage for X attacks

maybe draw attack by colors on stat screen

cache stat screen/tooltip?

increase max amount of enemies with levels

prevent movement of all mobs in current room
