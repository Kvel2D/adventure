PROBLEMS

killed merchant but picked up item and still had buy component on

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool

    boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
        copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
        spawning 3 skeletons in same room spawns a necromancer at stairs
        killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

find font that's not messed up in html5

scrolling for spell display, at some point spells won't fit in current area

equipment names

chain spell
    damages a mob and jumps to nearby mobs
        maybe each jump increases the damage
    jump range is generous, mobs don't have to be next to each other

summon wisps
    don't attack, only clump to player as a physical barrier
    maybe clump to enemy instead

mobs drop armor that is better than one found on the ground?

improve locked things
    for chests, keys could drop be inserted into a mob's droptable
        DropKey component that guarantees a drop of key

    for doors, just locking a single room with item is the same as a locked chest
    need to figure out how to lock a section of the map and place a key on the side reachable by player

statue that converts your copper into stats

randomization is often too much
    maybe merchant should spawn at least every 2 levels and always have at least one health potion as a way for player to offset bad luck

rock
    useless, but can be used as a blockade
