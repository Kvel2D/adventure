PROBLEMS

openfl release has an error in compress/uncompress for flash (github.com/openfl/starling/issues/117)

IDEAS

balance item/enemy ratio and potion amounts
    currently seems to be too many items
        lower enemy power/amount if necessary
        need to have enough items to fill inventory but not too much so that you don't have to routinely leave a bunch behind when going to next floor
    not sure if even need to rely on inventory filling mechanic
    but do want to have a lot of items so that playing is fun

enemies possibly die too fast
    need to at least be able to hit back once

try protrustions from walls
    pretty simple, pick a patch on wall, then extend it as a simple rectangle
    if there's space on outside of a cell, don't extend that one(meaning it would block a connection
