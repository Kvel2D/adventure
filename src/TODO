TODO

generate helpful potions randomly
    for attack mods, make it last a long time and have a few of them instead of having to chug a thousand attack mod potions that affect one attack

generate mobs randomly

start working on weighing the cost/benefit of mobs/items to make balanced dungeons

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS

one time a* pathfinding stopped when player is in front of hallway and entity was at same y and 2 cells away

IDEAS

portals

cells with effects
    poison - works like bloodborne, but full damage instantly at completion of meter, meter invisible, in effect allows for constant accumulation of poison in realtime which periodically "ticks"
    straight damage when stepping on for the first time (lava)

doors opened with buttons
    can make rooms be one-way entrance by putting a button and a door at the entrance
    (one way entrance poison room)

merchant block entrance to shop storage which contains a chest
    could attack merchant to open the way and get the chest but merchant is deadly

crab-hand
    crabs can be attacked but also can be used to gain +X to dmg for a limited time while taking damage periodically
    this is an aura
    crab disappears on end

pushable blocks ala sokoban
    use blocks to push a button to open a door
    but block is surround by enemies, need to clear them to be able to push it
    pushed by moving next to block
    can grab block for undoing purposes by holding G

rivalry - contains it's own "faction" and an enemy "faction", they attack each other instead of player if they are close

locked chests that need keys
locked doors that need keys(key spawned randomly in world a bit far away from door)

long-range attack for entities
    attacks player if no LOS(i.e. player can see it)

elements system
    fire, lightning, shadow(maybe something else too)
    each dmg bonus and stuff is one of those
    regular dmg is melee
    mobs can be resistant to some elements, including melee
        ex: a mob that can only be defeated with shadow
    dmg bonus spells for same element don't stack
        +2fire dmg followed by +4fire dmg = +4fire dmg
        limits the max amount of bonus you can get
        have to use multiple elements if you want to go crazy

make levels
    the world could be a tower

elemental affinity
    using an element, whether for attack/buff whatever else increases it's power
    every N uses you get a message "your fire affinity increased, fire spells are now more powerful"
    affinity level up improves one affinity but makes the opposite element worse
    fire <-> lightning
    shadow <-> light
    could make it so that increase is bigger than decrease

see everything spell
    turn off los

noclip "Ghostly Remainder" spell
    makes you be able to noclip for N turns
    death if inside wall at the end of the duration
        need to prevent player from going to boundary of world(some things break if that happens)

no pure immunity, only high resistance

think about whether to stack bonuses or not
    currently the highest bonus gets applied

spell that buffs entities
    increase random entity's health and attack
    increase all entity's health but also drop amount

increase effect of school in general
    increase light = higher light dmg, higher light heal amount, etc.(higher light dmg taken?)
    decrease light = lower light dmg, lower light heal, lower light dmg taken

special effects
turn off los
turn off collision
increase movespeed
increase copper droprate
increase item droprate
resistant to elements/ailments
invisibility, enemies can't chase you
increase armor by a factor
cure poison
extra life, restore full hp once when dying
swap stats with enemy
armor scale mod
armor flat mod
absorb mod

spell notes
    combat related bonuses should either be everyattack or everyturn but last long enough
    attack bonus that lasts 1 turn is useless
    temporary max health mod should have one tick only which lasts for N turns/attacks

make a markov chain name generator
    not sure if it will work well, need to test
    use animal names for corpus

entity editor in-game
    edit/add/remove all components

too many large rooms
    should scale rarity based on area


haxegon.geom has mathextensions functions

defense can be negative

instead of swapping weapon with enemy, swap attacks for all elements

mod equipment stat
    mod attack doesn't cover all options, it modifies natural attack only
    mod attack of weapon would only modify the weapon which presents an interesting choice of whether to enchant weapon now to get power now or save it for later to enchant a more powerful item

    mod attack should affect a specific element
    ex: enchant weapon with ice -> +1 ice attack

    could make it general: enchant equipment's ice power:
    increases attack or defense

    enchanting works like this:
        use the enchant item => set enchant flag
        if enchant flag => add "enchant" option in interact

    enchanting items/rings?
        could be fun

    two types of enchant:
        one that adds element power even if it's 0
        other that only increases existing element
            so enchanting ice on a sword with 1 phys dmg will do nothing 


make defense translate to absorb like this:
    82 defense = absorb 8 dmg always, 20% chance to absorb 9 dmg


can defense be negative?
    keep positive for now but should consider
    could work as a penalty for specializing too much into one element
        though on the other hand this might penalize it too hard

ranged attacks
    entities can attack if 2-3-4 away from player

other move types
    keep distance
        entity does nothing but when player to entity distance is lower than X it tries to get away
    chase and keep distance
        for entities with ranged attacks, they will chase player until reaching attack distance then try to keep distance

vary room geometry
    cut off walls around edges(keep connections)
    add walls inside rooms

dropping/equipping decrements spell counters
    not sure if good but i think i still do want item interactions to take a turn

make spell_effect_text() for what to print
    make a distinction between positive and negative values
    modhealth+1 = heal for 1
    modhealth-1 = damage by 1(damage? idk something else)

mob that heals itself over time
    new kind of spell ModEntityHealth?

make entities have defense instead of absorb because right now it's inconsistent with what the player sees, better for it to be same to be more easily understandble

attacking always takes prio, might need to disable attack while interact menu is up

html5 target draws text at incorrect locations
    might be related to the "pixel perfect" setting that's passed to haxegon

browsers need hardware acceleration apparently, need to put a note on game site
