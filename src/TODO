PROBLEMS

killed merchant but picked up item and still had buy component on

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool

    boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
        copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
        spawning 3 skeletons in same room spawns a necromancer at stairs
        killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

find font that's not messed up in html5

custom equipment and item names
    preset names that progress together with levels?
    copper sword/dagger/staff/hammer -> iron -> ...

summon wisps
    don't attack, only clump to player as a physical barrier
    maybe clump to enemy instead

improve locked things
    for chests, keys could drop be inserted into a mob's droptable
        DropKey component that guarantees a drop of key

    for doors, just locking a single room with item is the same as a locked chest
    need to figure out how to lock a section of the map and place a key on the side reachable by player

statue that converts your copper into stats

spell that increases all healing and damage to player for the rest of the level
    you could finish off all enemies on the level and then use it to boost your heal potions
    or you might really need healing now to complete the level in which case you are forced to use it then and there instead of waiting for the end of the level

    everyturn

    flat increase? flat increase scaled with level? double? 1.5x?

can form levels into shapes by using a probability map
    map regions of world so 150x150->15x15 or something in between
    each cell gets a probability

    when digging rooms, use a Random.chance() to reject positions randomly based on that probability
        maybe use the room center instead of position for better accuracy

    can do same thing for connections(use midpoint)

don't remove cross-connections?
    might be interesting to traverse
    though conflicts with the the tracking of entity/player room because connections would overlap
        do i still need to track rooms?
        not sure if it's even used anymore
