TODO

generate helpful potions randomly
    for attack mods, make it last a long time and have a few of them instead of having to chug a thousand attack mod potions that affect one attack

generate mobs randomly

start working on weighing the cost/benefit of mobs/items to make balanced dungeons

IDEAS

portals

display spell effect in tooltip for use and auto spells

cells with effects
    poison - works like bloodborne, but full damage instantly at completion of meter, meter invisible, in effect allows for constant accumulation of poison in realtime which periodically "ticks"
    straight damage when stepping on for the first time (lava)

doors opened with buttons
    can make rooms be one-way entrance by putting a button and a door at the entrance
    (one way entrance poison room)

merchant block entrance to shop storage which contains a chest
    could attack merchant to open the way and get the chest but merchant is deadly

crab-hand
    crabs can be attacked but also can be used to gain +X to dmg for a limited time while taking damage periodically
    this is an aura
    crab disappears on end

pushable blocks ala sokoban
    use blocks to push a button to open a door
    but block is surround by enemies, need to clear them to be able to push it
    pushed by moving next to block
    can grab block for undoing purposes by holding G

rivalry - contains it's own "faction" and an enemy "faction", they attack each other instead of player if they are close

locked chests that need keys
locked doors that need keys(key spawned randomly in world a bit far away from door)

long-range attack for entities
    attacks player if no LOS(i.e. player can see it)

elements system
    fire, lightning, shadow(maybe something else too)
    each dmg bonus and stuff is one of those
    regular dmg is melee
    mobs can be resistant to some elements, including melee
        ex: a mob that can only be defeated with shadow
    dmg bonus spells for same element don't stack
        +2fire dmg followed by +4fire dmg = +4fire dmg
        limits the max amount of bonus you can get
        have to use multiple elements if you want to go crazy

make levels
    the world could be a tower

elemental affinity
    using an element, whether for attack/buff whatever else increases it's power
    every N uses you get a message "your fire affinity increased, fire spells are now more powerful"
    affinity level up improves one affinity but makes the opposite element worse
    fire <-> lightning
    shadow <-> light
    could make it so that increase is bigger than decrease

see everything spell
    turn off los

noclip "Ghostly Remainder" spell
    makes you be able to noclip for N turns
    death if inside wall at the end of the duration
        need to prevent player from going to boundary of world(some things break if that happens)

no pure immunity, only high resistance

think about whether to stack bonuses or not
    currently the highest bonus gets applied

spell that buffs entities
    increase random entity's health and attack
    increase all entity's health but also drop amount

increase effect of school in general
    increase light = higher light dmg, higher light heal amount, etc.(higher light dmg taken?)
    decrease light = lower light dmg, lower light heal, lower light dmg taken

special effects
turn off los
turn off collision
increase movespeed
increase copper droprate
increase item droprate
resistant to elements/ailments
invisibility, enemies can't chase you
increase armor by a factor
cure poison
extra life, restore full hp once when dying
swap stats with enemy
armor scale mod
armor flat mod
absorb mod
