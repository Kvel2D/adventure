TODO

calculate weight of spells
    substract from attack buff value

some spell weight system is definitely needed, especially for constant buffs
    something like a function which returns the equivalent weapon damage for a spell type + spell value
        so a Chain Spell EveryAttack value=1 could be equivalent to 1.5 weapon damage
    then subtract combined spell weights from actual weapon damage and round or ceil

    so that if a weapon at some level X usually has 5 damage and it gets a chain spell, now it's damage is 4

    not sure how to adjust for stuff like summon spells, but they could be just a small number like 0.1-0.3 so that in combination with many other spells they decrease damage

    same thing is possible for negative spells so that now this stuff can be less hard-coded
        start with no damage and some damage "budget", do a random amount of positives which consumes some of the budget, then do a random amount of negatives which increases the budget back up, finally translate what's left into damage

        negatives shouldn't happen all the time of course   
            make some chance value for them occuring at all

    ok that some spells are not factored into this
        stuff like teleports or other more utility spell types can just be 0 weight

DONE

cache rendering of items in inventory and equipment


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEMS

openfl release has an error in compress/uncompress for flash (github.com/openfl/starling/issues/117)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool
    low chase distance so that player can choose when to engage

boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
    copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
    spawning 3 times on same floor spawns a necromancer at stairs
    killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

improve locked things
    for doors, just locking a single room with item is the same as a locked chest
        need to figure out how to lock a section of the map and place a key on the side reachable by player

redistribute spells between items and equipment

diversify spells more
    lots of spell variations aren't in

improve messages for spell effects

maybe remove ranged enemies
    combat with them is too awkward

max health thing NEEDS to be dealt with
    currently accidentaly swapping between armor with +max health decreases your hp

ring that you can consume for health

location teleport to another area

optimize entity rendering
    full inventory with charged items is very taxing right now
    also on the ground

    inventory rendering can be optimized easily
        track state of each slot, redraw on update
            can redraw fully or try erasing
            erasing to redraw only updated part would be optimal
            for erasing to work need to make sure that whatever the charge number, it should fit inside the square frame
            maybe enlarge it

    world rendering might be more challenging
        maybe create a separate entity layer

optimize a-star
    don't do a-star if don't need to
        check if straight-line path works

optimize world draw
    draw the whole world without shadows on one image when generating
        draw entities as well?

    draw shadows on top
