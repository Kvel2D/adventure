----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS

boss mobs
    guaranteed powerful item drop
    big health pool

    boss summon rituals
    doing some sequence of actions summons a special boss
        copying a copy scroll spawns copy scroll boss
        spawning 3 skeletons in same room spawns a necromancer at stairs
        killing 2 merchants spawns a merchant boss

find font that's not messed up in html5

scrolling for spell display, at some point spells won't fit in current area

vary room geometry by level
    restrict sizes to certain ranges
        all small rooms or all big rooms
        also connection factors

equipment names

cursed equipment
    both positive and negative bonuses are outside of normal range, so it gives very high positives and negatives
    don't want to affect normal equipment though, it should be a completely separate range of weights
    making the normal weight range extend higher won't work

statue that converts your copper into stats

keys should have some danger associated with them
    put them in enemy rooms and maybe increase the average amount of enemies in those rooms?

area spells should span multiple rooms and connections
    whole levels full of it? would need to make it less frequent and maybe increase value of stuff on the level
    whole level of teleportation would be pretty insane(ly fun)

maybe incrementing level not every floor, but every 2-3 floors would create a better power curve
    need to test side-by-side

quests
    an npc tells you that he'll give you copper or a good item if you defeat all enemies on the floor
        or maybe all enemies of type
    could also do a carry quest
        given item by one npc, have to carry it to an npc N floors later
        occupies a slot, but gives a reward in return

chain spell
    damages a mob and jumps to nearby mobs
        maybe each jump increases the damage
    jump range is generous, mobs don't have to be next to each other

summon wisps
    don't attack, only clump to player as a physical barrier
    maybe clump to enemy instead

mobs drop armor that is better than one found on the ground?

improve locked things
    for chests, keys could drop be inserted into a mob's droptable
        DropKey component that guarantees a drop of key

    for doors, just locking a single room with item is the same as a locked chest
    need to figure out how to lock a section of the map and place a key on the side reachable by player
